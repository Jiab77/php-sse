# PHP-SSE
Small HTML5 SSE library using PHP and Javascript.

# Instructions
You just have a couple of things to setup the library in your project.

 1. Define command line in file `sse.task.php`.
 2. Include the `SSE` variant you need in your `front-end` file.
 3. Include the `SSE` client `Javascript` code in your `front-end` file.
 4. Enjoy! :grin:

# Variants
There is two variants of the project.

 1. One that output `JSON` formatted data.
 2. One that output `RAW` data.

# Bonus
The output will get scrolled automatically!

# Demo
You can see the result for this run, when I'm exporting a database using `pg_dump`.
